          <p class="lead">
            Bootstrap is a toolkit from Twitter designed to kickstart development of webapps and sites.<br />
            It includes base CSS and HTML for typography, forms, buttons, tables, grids, navigation, and more.<br />
          </p>
          <p><strong>Nerd alert:</strong> Bootstrap is built with Less and was designed to work out of the gate with modern browsers in mind.</p>
